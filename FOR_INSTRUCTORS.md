# Intructor Notes

## Content

This set of notebooks was taught at the 2024 CERN School of Computing. The [notebooks](./notebooks) contain the following content:

1. Introduction to Backpropagation and first steps with Torch [01_intro2ml_penandpaper.ipynb](notebooks/01_intro2ml_penandpaper.ipynb)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks [02_convnets.ipynb](notebooks/02_convnets.ipynb)
3. An Introduction to Self-Attention [03_attention.ipynb](notebooks/03_attention.ipynb)
4. An Introduction to (Denoising) Autoencoders [04_autoencoders.ipynb](notebooks/04_autoencoders.ipynb)
5. Represenation Learning in Autoencoders and ConvNets [05_represenationlearning.ipynb](notebooks/05_represenationlearning.ipynb)

These notebooks are designed to be covered in 1h each. This design was validated in practice (except for the attention notebook). 

## Audience

The content is geared towards an audience which is fine with mathematical descriptions and can program in python.
